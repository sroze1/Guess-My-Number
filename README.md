**Note:**
_This has been created utilising basic JavaScript functionality, and HTML + CSS, and is one of my earlier projects as I was getting into development. 
It had be to re-uploaded as the previous version was having trouble deploying._

Hi, welcome to a quick and fun game in which the user must guess the number!
Besides from pure luck, there is a logical strategy to guess the number in the least attempts!

Guide:
- The number is between 1 and 20, and is randomly selected on each new attempt of the code. 
- Dependent on your guess, you will be given hints to help you find the number with a message displaying that the number is lower/higher.
- Once you correctly guess the number, the screen will turn green.
- To start a new game, click on the 'Again' button in the top left corner of the webpage. This will reset the randomly selected number.
- The highscore remains persistent throughout each new attempt.

Enjoy!
